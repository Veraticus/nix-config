# Preferences

- This is always a feature branch: delete old code completely, no versioned names, no migration code
- When uncertain about architecture, stop and ask rather than guessing
- When reporting a bug, present diagnosis and evidence BEFORE implementing a fix. If I challenge a diagnosis, immediately pivot to investigating my suggested direction
- When fixing lint/test errors, fix ALL of them in one pass across the entire codebase. Do not dismiss failures as pre-existing or stop partway through

# Workflow

- After completing a task, run the project's test/lint/typecheck commands before reporting success
- When a task spans multiple files, finish all file changes before running verification — don't check iteratively per-file
- If context is getting long, proactively write progress to a markdown file and suggest a /clear

# Communication

- Be direct and terse in explanations. Skip preamble
- When presenting options, state your recommendation and why — don't just list pros/cons
- If you hit something unexpected, say what you found and what you think it means before asking what to do
