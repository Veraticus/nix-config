# Performance profile selector
#
# Imports sub-modules and exposes a single option: performance.profile
# Each profile configures memory, network, and CPU tuning appropriate
# for the host's role.
#
# Profiles:
#   dev         - Bursty dev workloads (schedutil, low swappiness, MGLRU, BBR)
#   server      - Steady-state services (schedutil, moderate swappiness, MGLRU, BBR)
#   workstation - GPU compute / high-perf (performance governor, MGLRU, BBR, no zram)
#   constrained - Low-resource hosts (powersave, high swappiness, no MGLRU)
#   router      - Network-optimized (schedutil, BBR, minimal memory tuning)
#   none        - No tuning applied (default)
