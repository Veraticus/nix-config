# AMD CPU tuning based on performance profile
#
# Configures:
#   - amd_pstate driver in active mode (required for Zen 4+/Zen 5)
#   - CPU scaling governor (schedutil/performance/powersave)
#   - Energy Performance Preference (EPP) via CPPC
#   - Preferred core scheduling (critical for 3D V-Cache CPUs like 9800X3D)
#   - NVMe and SSD I/O scheduler (none - best for parallel queues)
#
# AMD-specific: the systemd service detects AMD CPUs at runtime
# and skips gracefully on Intel or other architectures.
#
# All values use lib.mkDefault so hosts can override.
