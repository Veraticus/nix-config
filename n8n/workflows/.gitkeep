# n8n Workflows

This directory contains git-tracked n8n workflow JSON files.

## Workflow

1. Claude creates workflow JSON files here
2. Run `update` to import them into n8n
3. Test/execute in n8n UI at https://n8n.husbuddies.gay
4. If you modify in UI, tell Claude to reconcile:
   - Run `n8n-export <workflow-id>` on ultraviolet
   - Copy exported JSON here
   - Claude reconciles changes

## Commands

```bash
# Export specific workflow for reconciliation
n8n-export <workflow-id>

# Export all workflows
n8n-export all

# Default export location: /tmp/n8n-export
```

## Notes

- Workflows are matched by ID - same ID = overwrite
- Credentials are NOT included - configure in n8n UI
- Changes sync git → n8n on rebuild, not reverse
