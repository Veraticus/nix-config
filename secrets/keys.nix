# Age public keys for agenix secret encryption.

# Structure:

#   users    — user SSH keys (from ~/.ssh/<key>.pub, converted via ssh-to-age)

# Output attributes match what secrets.nix expects:
#   keys.<hostname>  — host key + user key (for system-level agenix)
#   keys.joshsymonds — all user keys (for home-manager agenix)

# To audit a machine:
#   ssh-to-age -i /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub   # host key (NixOS only)
#   ssh-to-age -i ~/.ssh/github.pub                     # user key
